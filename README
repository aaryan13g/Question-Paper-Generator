First create a new database in your localhost. Here I have used the name of DB as "qpapergen".
Create a table Users with columns as id, usertype, username, password, created_at .
Create a table Topics with columns as sr_no, subject_code, subject_name .
Create a table Questions with columns as subject, difficulty, marks, timing, question, uploaded_by .

This question paper generator has the following features :-
- Two login modes - teacher and admin
- Teacher can add new questions for existing topics and generate random question papers according to their requirement.
- Admin can handle all the contact requests and create any new topics.
- The question paper is generated in a .rtf file in the local directory.
- A simplistic CSS environment.
